# Chip8 Interpreter
---
This repository contains an implementation of a Chip8 emulator written in C++. Chip8 is a simple, interpreted programming language created in the late 1970s, primarily used for educational purposes and simple video games.

The project contains functional and accurate emulation of the Chip8 CPU's instruction set and graphics - and handles keyboard input as well.
